                <h2>Who is Edwin Hubble</h2>
                <p>
                  Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 – September 28, 1953)
                  was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in
                  establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and
                  observational cosmology
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="panelTxt">
                <p>
                  Hubble proved that many objects previously thought to be
                  clouds of dust and gas and classified as "nebulae" were
                  actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He used the strong
                  direct relationship between a classical Cepheid variable's
                  luminosity and pulsation period for scaling galactic and
                  extragalactic distances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hubble's name is most widely recognized for the Hubble Space
                  Telescope, which was named in his honor, with a model
                  prominently displayed in his hometown of Marshfield, Missouri.

                <p>
                  A commission headed by Lew Allen, director of the Jet
                  Propulsion Laboratory, was established to determine how the
                  error could have arisen. The Allen Commission found that a
                  reflective null corrector, a testing device used to achieve a
                  properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly
                  assembled—one lens was out of position by 1.3 mm (0.051 in)

                <p>
                  During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror,
                  Perkin-Elmer analyzed its surface with two conventional
                  refractive null correctors. However, for the final
                  manufacturing step (figuring), they switched to the
                  custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to
                  meet very strict tolerances.

                  In an August 2013 press release, CANDELS was referred to as
                  "the largest project in the history of Hubble". The survey
                  "aims to explore galactic evolution in the early Universe, and

                  is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution
